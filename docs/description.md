### üß† RPC Functions

#### ‚úÖ `process_ad_watch(user_id uuid, captcha_input text)`

* Checks if user watched < 20 ads today.
* Validates CAPTCHA input (random string logic, can be preloaded client-side).
* Inserts row into `ads_watched`.
* Updates `earnings.ads_watched` for today.
* Adds coins to `users.coins`.
* Logs transaction.

#### üí∏ `process_withdrawal(user_id uuid, method text, upi_id text, bank_details jsonb)`

* Verifies minimum 15,000 coins.
* Deducts coins.
* Inserts into `withdrawals`.
* Logs transaction.

#### üîÑ `reset_daily_earnings()`

* Optional: Clean up `earnings` older than X days.
* Can use for analytics, or just rely on date grouping via queries.

---

### üîê Row-Level Security (RLS)

#### `users`

* ‚úÖ `SELECT/UPDATE` only where `auth.uid() = id`.
* üîê Admins via `role = 'service_role'` can access all.

#### `ads_watched`, `earnings`, `transactions`, `withdrawals`

* ‚úÖ Users can only `SELECT/INSERT` on their own `user_id`.
* ‚ùå No direct `UPDATE/DELETE`; only done via RPC.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Best Practices

* ‚úÖ Index `ads_watched(user_id, watched_at)`
* ‚úÖ Index `earnings(user_id, date)`
* ‚úÖ Index `transactions(user_id, created_at)`
* ‚úÖ Use `FOR UPDATE` in coin RPCs to prevent double rewards
* ‚úÖ All coin-modifying actions inside RPCs
* ‚úÖ Use `ON CONFLICT` for upserts (e.g., earnings)

---

### ‚ùì CAPTCHA Flow (String-Based)

Since you‚Äôre using **random string CAPTCHA**, no table needed.

**Flow:**

1. Frontend fetches random CAPTCHA image+string from CDN/local.
2. After ad ‚Üí show CAPTCHA ‚Üí user enters input.
3. On submit, call `process_ad_watch()` with `captcha_input`.
4. If input matches, reward and log.

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL STRUCTURE

* `users`
* `ads_watched`
* `earnings`
* `transactions`
* `withdrawals`
* üî• All logic in 2 core RPCs: `process_ad_watch`, `process_withdrawal`
* üîê RLS enabled + role-safe architecture
